### Hello, I'm Jonathan 👋

I'm a front-end engineer at The Scottish Government, working on the nation-state website [gov.scot](https://www.gov.scot) the citizen-focussed [mygov.scot](https://www.mygov.scot) and the [Digital Scotland Design System](https://designsystem.gov.scot).

I'm an accessibility nerd and, as a former designer, very interested in creating attractive and above all _usable_ user interfaces.

- 🏗️ Lately I am mostly working on the [Digital Scotland Design System](https://github.com/scottishgovernment/pattern-library)
- 💬 Ask me about CSS, front-end build tooling, accessibility
