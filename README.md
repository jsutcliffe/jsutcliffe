### Hello, I'm Jonathan 👋

I'm a front-end engineer at The Scottish Government, working on the nation-state website [gov.scot](https://www.gov.scot) and the citizen-focussed [mygov.scot](https://www.mygov.scot).

I'm an accessibility nerd and, as a former designer, very interested in creating attractive and above all _usable_ user interfaces.

- 🏗️ I'm currently working on the [Digital Scotland Design System](https://github.com/scottishgovernment/pattern-library)
- 🏫 I'm currently learning and polishing my JS unit testing skills 
- 💬 Ask me about CSS, front-end build tooling, accessibility
- 📫 Get in touch at [jonathan.sutcliffe@gov.scot](mailto:jonathan.sutcliffe@gov.scot) or [@jams_o_donnell](https://twitter.com/jams_o_donnell)
- 🕺 My pronouns are he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My home is surrounded by a farm. All the fun of the farm animals with none of the responsibility 🐑 🐄
